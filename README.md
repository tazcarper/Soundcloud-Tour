## Soundcloud Tour App (Really early Alpha)

I use Soundcloud a lot. I follow a lot of artists and I wanted to know when they were going on tour. I was surprised Soundcloud didn't have any sort of built in feature for this... So I started to build Soundcloud Tour.

Here is what Soundcloud Tour does:

1. Connect with your Soundcloud Account.
2. Find all the artists you follow.
3. Compile list of artists with tour dates listed on their account.
4. Sort that list and display.

To do list (as of right now)
1. Save list so it doesn't built out every time.
2. Filter by distance.
3. Filter by Location (region maybe?).
4. Filter by Festival / non-festival
5. Brand this thing?
